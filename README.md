# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
nvm use 16
# rename .env.example to .env
# replace alchemy url and private key in .env file
npm i 
yarn hardhat test

# delete the artifacts & cache folder
npx hardhat deploy --network goerli
```
